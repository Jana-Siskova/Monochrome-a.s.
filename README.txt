Adventure Games: Monochrome a.s. Companion App

Welcome to the Adventure Games: Monochrome a.s. Companion App! This application is specifically crafted to enhance your board game experience by providing a digital alternative to the traditional adventure book included with the game. Here, players can seamlessly search for numbered entries that guides you through the game.

The idea for this app came from the absence of a Czech version of the official Helper App by Thames & Kosmos, which offers electronic versions of manuals and adventure books for their games. To fill this gap, I've created a solution for Adventure Games: Monochrome a.s. enthusiasts, as a fan project born out of my love for the game.

Companion app is still work in progress. I want to create nicer visual, add help section and tutorial.

Features
Digital Adventure Book: Replace the traditional adventure book with a digital version, making it easier for players to navigate and enjoy the game.
Search Functionality: Quickly find and access specific numbered entries.
